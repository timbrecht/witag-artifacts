decode      - filter and decode messages received in block ACKS
sender-ap   - set up the sender, transmit packets, 
              receive and store block acks, convert tcpdump data to
              something easier to read and process, scripts used to call decode
sensors     - example of how we do the live demos - the sender decodes
              messages, writes them to files which are served via a web server
tag         - code used on the Arduino to send messages
