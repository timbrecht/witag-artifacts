- Added support for writing to different files for different sensors
  -U # is used to specify the # of sensors
  -O path/file is used as the basis of the names when -U # is used.
     So -U 2 results in files path/file0 path/file1

- Started generally but decided I would just support 2 for now.

- Changed to malloc/calloc memory that was previously on the stack in
  deocde.c

- Adding -0 # options to specify what type of sensor sensor 0 is
- Adding -1 # options to specify what type of sensor sensor 1 is
See sensor.h for the different sensor types
- Note that currently SENSOR_TYPE_ANGLE uses factor and offset
  and so does SENSOR_TYPE_LIGHT - we may need to change the way
  that one of these works.

  Maybe for ANGLE we just give MAX_VALUE and use 2^B / MAX_VALUE
  as the factor and don't use an offset - or something like that
